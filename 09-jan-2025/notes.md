- First class of the Winter 2025 academic term.

- The professor introduced herself and each one of us students.

- For representing matrices in Python we can use Numpy, Pandas, etc.

- Today we reviewed some methods and formulas to operate with matrices of 2x2 and 3x3.

- Some concepts to review about matrices and their operations:
    - **Square Matrix:** the number of rows equals the number of columns *(n x n)*.
    - **Identity Matrix (I):** a square matrix with *1's* on the diagonal (from top left to bottom right) and *0's* elsewhere.
    - **Zero Matrix:** A matrix with all elements as 0.
    - **Addition and Subtraction:** matrices can only be added/subtracted if they have the *same dimensions*.
    - **Scalar Multiplication:** multiply every element by a scalar.
    - **Matrix Multiplication:** multiply two matrices if the *number of columns in the first matrix* equals the *number of rows in the second*.
    - **Division (Matrix Inverse Multiplication):** use the inverse of a matrix for division-like behavior.
    - **Determinant of square matrix:** is a scalar that indicates its invertibility and the scaling factor of its transformation.
    - **Inverse of a square matrix:** *A* is another matrix $\ A^{-1} $ such that $\ A * A^{-1} = A^{-1} * A = I $, where *I* is the identity matrix.
    - **Transposing a matrix:** changing its rows and columns.

- Some concepts to review about vectors:
    - **Vector:** is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. It can be represented as a column or row matrix.
    - **Magnitude of a vector:** represents its **size** and **length**.
    - **Direction of a vector**: indicates the way it points in space. It is often described as an **angle** relative to a reference axis.
    - **Dot Product:** The dot product (also called the scalar product) is an operation that takes two vectors and *produces a single number* (a scalar). **It measures how much one vector aligns with another.**
        - Is **positive** when the two vectors point roughly in the same direction.
        - It is **zero** when the vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal).
        - It is **negative** when the vectors point in opposite directions.
